# CHILDES communicative feedback

This repository contains code accompanying the following paper:

**Communicative Feedback as a Mechanism Supporting the Production of Intelligible Speech in Early Childhood** \
*In Proceedings of the 44th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society. (2022)* \
Mitja Nikolaus, Laurent Pr√©vot and Abdellah Fourtassi

To reproduce the exact results from the paper, the
[cogsci_2022](https://github.com/mitjanikolaus/childes-communicative-feedback/tree/cogsci_2022) branch should be used.
The main branch contains some addtional tweaks for the preprocessing of utterances.

## Python Environment

You can create an environment using the [environment.yml](environment.yml) file (if you're not on Ubuntu, you can also
use the [environment_os_independent.yml](environment_os_independent.yml) file:
```
conda env create --file environment.yml

```
Additionally, we need to install [my fork of the pylangacq repo](https://github.com/mitjanikolaus/pylangacq) (The original repo can be found here: [pylangacq](https://github.com/jacksonllee/pylangacq)) using pip:
```
git clone git@github.com:mitjanikolaus/pylangacq.git
cd pylangacq
source activate cf
pip install .
```

## Data

### CHILDES corpora
All CHILDES corpora listed in 'preprocess.py' need to be downloaded from the
[CHILDES database](https://childes.talkbank.org/) and extracted to `~/data/CHILDES/`.

The following corpora were considered in the analyses:
Bernstein, Bloom, Braunwald, Brent, Edinburgh, Gleason, MPI-EVA-Manchester, MacWhinney, McCune, McMillan, Nelson, NewmanRatner, Peters, Providence, Rollins, Sachs, Snow, Soderstrom, Thomas, Tommerdahl, VanHouten, Weist

## Preprocessing

The CHILDES corpus data is loaded using [my fork of the pylangacq repo](https://github.com/mitjanikolaus/pylangacq)

To preprocess the data, once you've installed the [pylangacq](https://github.com/mitjanikolaus/pylangacq) library as
mentioned above, you can run:
```
python preprocess.py --require-timing-information --corpora Edinburgh VanHouten MPI-EVA-Manchester McMillan Rollins Gleason Forrester Braunwald Bloom McCune Tommerdahl Soderstrom Weist NewmanRatner Snow Thomas Peters MacWhinney Sachs Bernstein Brent Nelson Providence
```
This preprocessed all corpora that are conversational (have child AND caregiver transcripts), are English, and
have timing information.

Afterwards, annotate speech-relatedness and intelligibility:
```
python annotate.py
```

Finally, the utterances need to be annotated with speech acts. Use the method `crf_annotate` from the following
repo: [childes-speech-acts](https://github.com/mitjanikolaus/childes-speech-acts).
```
python crf_annotate.py --model checkpoint_full_train --data ~/data/communicative_feedback/utterances_annotated.csv --out ~/data/communicative_feedback/utterances_with_speech_acts.csv --use-pos --use-bi-grams --use-repetitions
```

## Analyses

The scripts `analysis_reproduce_warlaumont.py` and `analysis_intelligibility` perform the respective analyses and
produce the plots.

The scripts `analysis_reproduce_warlaumont_glm.py` and `analysis_intelligibility_glm.py` are used for the GLM analyses
of the results.


## Annotation Scheme

### Intelligibility

The [CHAT coding scheme](https://talkbank.org/manuals/CHAT.pdf) offers multple ways to transcribe unintelligible
utterances. Here we list all cases that were most commonly used (the different corpora considered in our study make very
varying use of the different codes).

| Code       | Description                                                                                                                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| xxx        | Unintelligible Speech                                                                                                                      |
| yyy        | Phonological Coding                                                                                                                        |
| @p         | Phonological Fragments (see above), e.g., bababa@p                                                                                         |
| \&         | Phonological Fragments (see above), e.g., \&baba                                                                                           |
| @b         | Babbling, e.g., bababa@b                                                                                                                   |
| \&=event   | Format used to transcribe ``simple events'', sometimes used for unintelligible speech: \&=babbling, \&=vocalizes                           |
| [=! event] | Format used to transcribe ``paralinguistic events'', sometimes used for unintelligible speech: [=! babbling], [=! voc]                     |
| word | Sometimes babbling is not explicitely, marked, but just transcribed as a normal word. We catch the most common cases e.g., "baba", "bababa" |
